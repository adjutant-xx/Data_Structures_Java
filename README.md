# Data_Structures_Java
A collection of common data structures and algorithms written in Java.

## Synopsis
This repository includes Java code representing commonly found data structures and the algorithms used within their implementation.

## Motivation
I took it upon myself to gain a better understanding of how data structures work at a fundamental level, and this repository offers me the perfect opportunity to enhance my learning. This project is by no means a finished product, but rather a place where I can frequently refine my understanding and practices. Consistently revisiting my implementations of these data structures helps to reinforce how they function, where and when to use them, and why they are so important.

##Usage
This project includes several different packages, one for each generic type of data structure; so far only HashTable, Linked List, and Tree has been added.  Each package contains code files for the internals of the structure being represented, as well as a Main file that acts as a simple test suite for the functions of the data structure.
NOTE: Each package's Main file will be replaced with proper unit tests.
